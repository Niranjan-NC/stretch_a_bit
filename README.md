Select an RC low pass filter circuit to produce a variable analogÂ voltage from a resistor and capacitor. With a pulse voltage of 5V amplitude, the capacitor is connected in parallel to the resistor. LT spice schematics are attached in this.
1. The resistor and capacitor values for the first example are 10K ohm and 0.1uF, respectively. 
PWM duty cycles are varied by 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.
The predicted result and the voltage difference are shown as "Draft1.jpg" and "Draft1_voltage.jpg," respectively, in the attachments.
2. In the following example, the resistor is 70K ohms in value and the capacitor is 5nF.  PWM duty cycles are varied by 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The predicted result and the voltage difference are shown as "Draft2.jpg" and "Draft2_voltage," respectively, in the attachments.

I'm sorry to inform that I was unable to run this in Python since I was unable to install the necessary peripherals for LTSpice. I made numerous attempts to fix the problem, but it was impossible. Either my system has a flaw, or I made a mistake that I was unable to correct.
